Description: Provides tools to compute unbiased pleiotropic heritability estimates of complex diseases from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics. We estimate pleiotropic heritability from GWAS summary statistics by estimating the proportion of variance explained from an estimated genetic correlation matrix (Bulik-Sullivan et al. 2015 <doi:10.1038/ng.3406>) and employing a Monte-Carlo bias correction procedure to account for sampling noise in genetic correlation estimates.
